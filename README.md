# Scriptium

**Scriptium** is a project designed to facilitate research and foster discussions among users about religious texts from around the world. It aggregates religious texts from reputable sources recognized by their respective communities. You can find these sources in the **/about** section of the Scriptium website.

Scriptium is primarily intended for theological research and the exchange of ideas about religious texts, but itâ€™s also designed to be accessible for everyday readers. Moreover, Scriptium actively listens to user feedback to improve its features and functionality.

## Scriptium Discord Bot

Scriptium has a Discord bot that allows users to access the content of https://scriptium.net quickly and without opening a browser. For now, this bot allows users to access verses only. In the future, users will be able to do nearly anything they can do on the Scriptium website.

## Features

For now, there is only one command that users execute:

`/read {scriptureCode} {sectionNumber} {chapterNumber} {verseNumber} {translation}? {variation}?`

### Explanation of parameters:

- scriptureCode: The code of the Scripture the user wants to access. For instance, t for Torah.

- sectionNumber: The number of the section according to the Scripture.

- chapterNumber: The number of the chapter according to the section.

- verseNumber: The number of the verse according to the chapter.

- translation? (optional): The desired translation of the verse. If not provided, the default translation will be displayed.

- variation? (optional): The variation of the original text (e.g., with/without nikkud for the Torah). If not available, the default one will be displayed.
